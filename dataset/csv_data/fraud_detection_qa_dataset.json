            "question": "What is fraud detection?",
            "answer": "Fraud detection is the process of identifying and preventing unauthorized or illegal activities that result in financial or data loss. It involves using various techniques, algorithms, and systems to recognize patterns and anomalies that indicate fraudulent behavior. The goal is to minimize false positives while catching actual fraud attempts in real-time or near real-time.",

            "question": "What is synthetic identity fraud?",
            "answer": "Synthetic identity fraud occurs when criminals create fake identities by combining real and fabricated information, such as using a real Social Security number with a fake name and address. Unlike traditional identity theft, the victim might be unaware for years. This type of fraud is particularly difficult to detect because the synthetic identity appears legitimate and can build credit history over time before defaulting on large amounts. It's one of the fastest-growing financial crimes in the United States.",

            "answer": "Account takeover fraud occurs when criminals gain unauthorized access to a victim's account through stolen credentials, phishing, social engineering, or data breaches. Once inside, they may change account details, make unauthorized transactions, apply for credit, or use the account as a launching point for further fraud. ATO is particularly damaging because it exploits existing trust relationships and can be difficult to detect if the criminal mimics normal user behavior.",

            "question": "What is rule-based fraud detection?",
            "answer": "Rule-based fraud detection uses predefined rules and thresholds to identify suspicious activities. For example: transactions over $10,000, purchases from high-risk countries, or multiple failed login attempts. While easy to implement and interpret, rule-based systems can generate high false positives, are easy for fraudsters to learn and circumvent, and require constant manual updates as fraud patterns evolve. They're often used as a first line of defense combined with more sophisticated methods.",

            "question": "What is anomaly detection in fraud prevention?",
            "answer": "Anomaly detection identifies patterns that deviate significantly from expected behavior. It works by establishing a baseline of normal activity and flagging transactions or behaviors that fall outside this norm. Techniques include statistical methods (z-score, IQR), clustering algorithms (k-means, DBSCAN), and neural networks (autoencoders). Anomaly detection is particularly useful for detecting novel fraud patterns that haven't been seen before, but it can produce false positives when legitimate behavior is unusual.",

            "answer": "Velocity checking monitors the frequency and volume of transactions within a specific time period. It flags suspicious patterns like multiple transactions from the same card in a short time, numerous transactions from different geographic locations, rapid-fire login attempts, or sudden spikes in activity. For example, if a card is used in New York and then in London 30 minutes later, this is physically impossible and indicates fraud. Velocity rules are effective for catching certain fraud types but must be calibrated carefully to avoid false positives.",

            "question": "What is device fingerprinting and how does it help detect fraud?",
            "answer": "Device fingerprinting creates a unique identifier for a device based on its characteristics such as browser type, operating system, screen resolution, installed fonts, plugins, IP address, and hardware specifications. This helps detect fraud by identifying when multiple accounts are accessed from the same device, when a known fraudulent device is used, or when account credentials are accessed from a new, unrecognized device. It's particularly effective against account takeover and bot-driven fraud.",

            "category": "Machine Learning",
            "question": "What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning in fraud detection?",
            "answer": "Supervised learning uses labeled historical data (known fraud and legitimate transactions) to train models that predict whether new transactions are fraudulent. It requires quality labeled data and works well for known fraud patterns. Unsupervised learning finds patterns without labels, useful for detecting new, unknown fraud types through clustering or anomaly detection. In practice, a hybrid approach is often best: unsupervised methods identify suspicious patterns for investigation, which then creates labels for supervised learning.",

            "question": "What are autoencoders and how are they used in fraud detection?",
            "answer": "Autoencoders are neural networks that learn to compress data into a lower-dimensional representation and then reconstruct it. For fraud detection, they're trained on legitimate transactions to learn what 'normal' looks like. When a transaction cannot be accurately reconstructed (high reconstruction error), it's flagged as potentially fraudulent. This unsupervised approach is effective for detecting novel fraud patterns and works well with unlabeled data, though it requires careful threshold tuning to minimize false positives.",

            "question": "How do graph neural networks help detect fraud?",
            "answer": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) analyze relationships between entities (users, accounts, devices, merchants) represented as nodes and edges in a graph. They're effective because fraud often involves networks of connected entities. GNNs can detect: fraud rings where multiple accounts work together, money laundering through transaction chains, collusion patterns, and account relationships that indicate organized fraud. They capture both entity features and network structure, making them powerful for detecting sophisticated, organized fraud that individual transaction analysis might miss.",

            "question": "What is Benford's Law and how is it used in fraud detection?",
            "answer": "Benford's Law states that in many naturally occurring datasets, the leading digit is more likely to be small. For example, '1' appears as the first digit about 30% of the time, while '9' appears only 4.6% of the time. In fraud detection, deviations from Benford's Law can indicate manipulation, as humans tend to distribute fabricated numbers more uniformly. It's used to detect accounting fraud, tax evasion, and financial statement manipulation. However, it only applies to certain types of data and shouldn't be the sole detection method.",

            "question": "How do you calculate the expected fraud loss and set appropriate thresholds?",
            "answer": "Expected fraud loss is calculated as: (Fraud Rate × Average Fraud Amount × Number of Transactions). To set thresholds, you need to balance: 1) Cost of missed fraud (chargebacks, losses), 2) Cost of false positives (manual reviews, customer friction), 3) Operational capacity for investigations. The optimal threshold minimizes total cost. Use precision-recall curves to visualize trade-offs, A/B testing to validate threshold changes, and business input to weight different types of errors. Consider separate thresholds for different risk segments or transaction types.",

            "question": "What is the chi-square test used for in fraud detection?",
            "answer": "The chi-square test determines if there's a significant association between categorical variables, such as whether fraud rates differ significantly across customer segments, merchant categories, or geographic regions. In fraud detection, it helps: identify high-risk categories, validate that features are useful for prediction, detect temporal patterns (fraud rates by day/hour), and test if fraud is uniformly distributed or concentrated in specific groups. It's particularly useful for feature selection and understanding fraud distribution patterns.",

            "question": "What is behavioral biometrics and how does it detect fraud?",
            "answer": "Behavioral biometrics analyzes unique patterns in how users interact with devices and applications, including typing rhythm, mouse movements, touchscreen pressure, scrolling patterns, navigation habits, and usage timing. These patterns are difficult for fraudsters to replicate even with stolen credentials. The system creates a behavioral profile during legitimate use and flags deviations as potential fraud. It's particularly effective for continuous authentication and detecting account takeover, as fraudsters typically exhibit different behavioral patterns than the legitimate user.",

            "answer": "User profiling creates detailed models of normal behavior for each customer based on historical activity: typical transaction amounts, preferred merchants, geographic patterns, device usage, login times, and browsing behavior. Fraud is detected when activity deviates from this profile, such as unusual purchase amounts, new merchant categories, transactions from unexpected locations, or accessing accounts at odd hours. Dynamic profiling updates continuously as behavior evolves, while considering contextual factors like holidays or life events that legitimately change patterns.",

            "answer": "Session-based analytics examine entire user sessions rather than individual events, analyzing sequence of actions, time spent on pages, navigation flow, form interaction patterns, and session duration. Fraudsters often exhibit different session behaviors: rushing through checkout, skipping typical browsing, avoiding terms/conditions, using auto-fill differently, or showing bot-like precision in clicks. Machine learning models (RNNs, LSTMs) can learn normal session patterns and detect anomalies. This holistic view catches sophisticated fraud that might appear normal in isolated transactions.",

            "answer": "Real-time processing analyzes transactions as they occur (within milliseconds) to approve, decline, or flag them before completion. This is critical because: 1) It prevents fraud before losses occur, 2) It enables immediate customer experience (no delays), 3) It's required for payment authorization, 4) It allows dynamic risk adjustment. Challenges include: high throughput requirements, low latency demands (<100ms), model complexity trade-offs, and maintaining accuracy under time constraints.

            "answer": "Address Verification Service compares the billing address provided during a transaction with the address on file with the card issuer. It returns codes indicating match status for street address and ZIP code. AVS helps prevent card-not-present fraud because fraudsters often don't know the cardholder's correct billing address. However, AVS has limitations: it only works in some countries, may have data quality issues, doesn't prevent all fraud types, and can create friction for legitimate customers with recently changed addresses or those using delivery addresses.",

            "answer": "3D Secure (including 3DS2) adds an authentication layer for online card transactions, requiring cardholders to verify their identity with the issuing bank during checkout. The latest version (3DS2) uses risk-based authentication, analyzing 100+ data points to assess transaction risk. Low-risk transactions may be approved frictionlessly, while higher-risk ones require step-up authentication (PIN, OTP, biometrics). Benefits include liability shift to issuers for authenticated transactions, reduced chargebacks, and improved customer experience. However, it can add checkout friction if not implemented properly.",

            "answer": "Tokenization replaces sensitive payment data (card numbers) with unique identification tokens that have no intrinsic value. If a system is breached, stolen tokens are useless to fraudsters. Network tokenization (by Visa, Mastercard) creates tokens valid across merchants, updating automatically when cards are reissued. Payment tokenization (merchant-specific) keeps card data secure in vaults. Benefits include: reduced PCI compliance scope, protection against data breaches, improved transaction approval rates, and enhanced customer experience through saved payment methods without storing actual card numbers.",

            "answer": "Velocity limits restrict the frequency or volume of specific actions within a time window: maximum transactions per hour, daily spending limits, number of card attempts, account creation limits per IP, or login attempts before lockout. These limits catch fraudsters who: test stolen cards rapidly, make multiple purchases before detection, create numerous fake accounts, or attempt credential stuffing attacks.

It mandates: secure network infrastructure, cardholder data protection, vulnerability management, access controls, network monitoring, and information security policies. While primarily focused on data security, PCI DSS indirectly prevents fraud by: protecting card data from breaches, requiring fraud detection systems, enforcing strong authentication, maintaining audit trails, and implementing secure development practices. Non-compliance can result in fines and increased fraud risk.",

            "question": "What is the role of negative lists and blacklists in fraud prevention?",
            "answer": "Negative lists/blacklists contain known fraudulent entities: stolen card numbers, compromised devices, fraud email addresses, suspicious IP addresses, known fraudster identities. Types: 1) Internal blacklists from past fraud, 2) Industry consortiums sharing fraud data, 3) Third-party providers selling fraud intelligence, 4) Credit bureau negatives, 5) Law enforcement lists. Usage: instant blocking or high-risk scoring of blacklisted entities. Challenges: maintaining accuracy (remove resolved cases), data quality, false positives (shared IPs, resold devices), privacy regulations, list size management, and real-time lookup performance. Modern approach: risk scoring rather than absolute blocking, combining multiple negative lists, and regularly reviewing and purging outdated entries.",

            "question": "How do you balance fraud prevention with customer experience?",
            "answer": "Balancing requires: 1) Risk-based approach—friction for high-risk only, 2) Frictionless methods—device fingerprinting, behavioral analytics work silently, 3) Adaptive authentication—step-up only when needed, 4) Smart declines—clear communication with appeal path, 5) Whitelist trusted customers—reduced scrutiny for known good users, 6) Fast manual review—minimize customer wait times, 7) Proactive communication—notify before blocking, 8) Multiple payment options—alternatives if one fails. Metrics: approval rate, false positive rate, customer satisfaction, conversion rate, fraud loss. Testing: A/B test fraud rules impact on experience, survey customers after friction events. Remember: excessive friction drives customers to competitors while inadequate security causes fraud losses.",

            "answer": "Containerization (Docker, Kubernetes) packages applications with dependencies into isolated containers. Benefits for fraud detection: 1) Consistent environments—same behavior dev to production, 2) Easy scaling—spin up containers for high transaction volumes, 3) Fast deployment—quick model updates, 4) Resource efficiency—better hardware utilization, 5) Version control—different model versions in containers, 6) A/B testing—parallel containers for challenger models, 7) Isolation—models don't interfere, 8) Portability—move between cloud providers. Architecture: model inference containers handling prediction requests, feature computation containers, decision engine containers. Orchestration (Kubernetes) manages scaling, health monitoring, rolling updates, and traffic routing.",

            "answer": "Continuous authentication verifies identity throughout a session rather than just at login, using behavioral biometrics, device fingerprinting, and activity patterns. Benefits: 1) Detects account takeover mid-session, 2) Identifies session hijacking, 3) Monitors for bot takeovers, 4) Adapts to behavior changes in real-time, 5) Enables dynamic risk adjustment during session. Techniques: keystroke dynamics, mouse movements, touchscreen pressure patterns, typing rhythm, navigation patterns, app usage timing. Implementation: establish baseline behavior, continuously score behavior against profile, trigger challenges when confidence drops, log out suspicious sessions. Challenges: balancing security with false positives, privacy considerations, computational overhead, and avoiding user frustration.",

            "question": "What is bust-out fraud and how can it be detected early?",
            "answer": "Bust-out fraud involves building credit legitimacy then suddenly maxing out credit with no intention to repay. Stages: 1) Application with synthetic/stolen identity, 2) Small transactions to build history, 3) Timely payments establishing trust, 4) Credit limit increases, 5) Sudden maximum utilization, 6) Default/abandonment. Early detection signals: 1) Rapid credit limit increase requests, 2) Sudden change in transaction patterns, 3) Large cash advances, 4) Balance transfers, 5) Multiple accounts opened simultaneously across institutions, 6) Unusual payment patterns (minimum payments suddenly), 7) Contact information changes, 8) Network connections to other bust-out accounts. Prevention: gradual credit increases, velocity limits, consortium data sharing, behavioral monitoring, synthetic identity detection.",

            "answer": "A/B testing compares fraud detection strategies by randomly assigning transactions to control (current approach) and treatment (new approach) groups. Purpose: measure impact of rule changes, model updates, or new features on fraud rates, approval rates, and customer experience. Safe conduct: 1) Start with small traffic percentage (5-10%) to treatment, 2) Set clear success metrics and stopping criteria, 3) Monitor both fraud and business metrics, 4) Implement kill switch for immediate rollback, 5) Use statistical significance testing, 6) Account for delayed fraud labels (chargebacks take time), 7) Consider stratified sampling for fair comparison, 8) Run long enough for statistical power but not so long to incur losses. Never A/B test removing all fraud checks—always maintain baseline protection.",
