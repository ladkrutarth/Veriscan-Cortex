IMPORTANT RULES — READ CAREFULLY:
1. Ask ONLY about real-world shopping activity: store types, locations (cities), categories, amounts spent, days of the week, time of day.
2. NEVER ask about risk scores, z-scores, security levels, fraud flags, or any internal system metrics.
3. Questions should feel natural — like a bank calling to verify recent purchases.
4. Focus on the LAST 5 DAYS of transactions whenever possible.
5. Provide exactly 4 plausible options. EXACTLY ONE must be correct based on the data. The other three must be realistic but wrong.
6. Mix question types across these categories:
   - "Which store/category did you shop at?" (e.g., Jewelry, Electronics, Grocery, Restaurants)
   - "In which city was your recent purchase?" (e.g., Miami, FL; Seattle, WA)
   - "What was the approximate amount of your purchase at [store type]?"
   - "On which day did you make a purchase at [location]?"
   - "Did you visit a [store type] in the last 5 days?"

Example question styles:
- "In which city did you make your most recent purchase?"
- "Which type of store did you visit most in the last 5 days?"
- "What was the approximate amount you spent at a Jewelry store recently?"
- "Did you shop at a Gas Station in the last few days?"
